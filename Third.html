           <h3>Daffy's first appearance is a bigger landmark than expected.
                <p>Porky's Duck Hunt did more than introduced the world to Daffy Duck; This would be the first time Mel Blanc would voice Porky Pig full time.  Joe Daughtry voiced Porky originally, but had a hard time as he really stuttered.  Blanc went to a pig farm to help better understand the voice and came to the conclusion that it's not a stutter, but rather a grunt.  Blanc would voice the majority of the Looney Tunes characters ever since.</p>

           <h3>Despite Bugs's star power, Daffy is a fan favorite.
                <p>The cartoons and the studio would tell you that Bugs is the real star of Looney Tunes, but many Looney Tunes fans will admit that Daffy Duck is the favorite out of the group.  This is because Daffy will 100% mess with his adversaries whenever he wants.  Bugs, however, will only attack when provoked</p>

           <h3>The Bugs and Daffy rivalry started in 1959
                <p>Bugs and Daffy never truly met until 1943 at then end of Porky Pig's Feat.  It was there when he claimed Bugs to be his hero and calls him up.  It wasn't until Chuck Jones teamed the two up in Rabbit Fire that changed the game for Daffy Duck.  It marked the first time Daffy was the bad guy and there was no turning back for the rivalry between the two in future cartoons.</p>
